NFC share plugin for Sailfish OS
================================

Shares text as an NDEF record by emulating a Type 4A NFC tag.
What looks like a URL gets transformed into a URI record and
everything else becomes a Text record.

NFCForum-TS-Type-4-Tag specification limits the size of an
NDEF record shared this way by 0xfffc bytes.
